One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project. Tell us about your project.

Our theme is money saving so this website is meant for the user to track how much they have spent. With the use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, we have made a website to cater to these people. We want to use a reward system in our app and website to encourage users to spend their money more wisely as the more they save, the more they can earn. The rewards that the user can earn are either trophys or real life money. To achieve this, the user has to input their income at the start of each month but has to input in their expenses every day. This is for the calculation of how much the user earned in that day to be inputed in the graph as well as the number of points the user earns.

Design Process
Provide us insights about your design process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

This website is meant for people aged 18 and above who want to reduce their spendings per month. Our website allows the user to track their spendings using a graph which displays how much they saved. Users can set group financial goals so that they can all contribute in saving up for example a gift for a friend. Since we have a rewards system which rewards the user with real money and trophys, they will be more motivated to use our website. To better enhance their experience, the user just has to input their income whenever they login to tell us how much they saved.


In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user, I want to set financial goals so that I can reduce my spendings.
As a user, I want to see my progress on how much I have saved so that I can improve on how I can spend wisely.
As a user, I want to be able to claim rewards for saving money so that I can earn points.
As a user, I want to be able to add my friends so that we can make a group financial goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory) Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.

Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

Existing Features
Feature 1: API - allows users to send their account details to restdb
Feature 2: Lottie - loading animation when loading new page
Feature 3: Account information - section should show filled in details from the API in the signup page
...
In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

Features Left to Implement:
Update the graph using the API
Code to allow user to update password
Allow user to sign in using their already made account
Clicking the achievement will show the trophy

Another feature idea

Technologies Used
ChatGPT: https://chat.openai.com/ for some code which we were unsure of how to do.
Chart.js: https://www.chartjs.org/ for the graph in the plan and track.html file.
LottieFiles: https://lottiefiles.com/ for the loading animation in lottie.html before going to the home page.
RestDB: https://restdb.io/ for the API in the index.html page and the account.html page to look at the user's account information.
Github: https://github.com/Kevin-Heng/KevKoon_IP.git

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

HTML is used for the making of the pages for the website.
CSS is used to make the design of the website.
JavaScript is used for the layout of the website and the linking of the API to RestDb.

Testing
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Signup form:
Go to the "Signup" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
